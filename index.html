      DESIGN WAS so much easier before I had clients. I assigned myself projects
      with no requirements, no schedule, no budget, no constraints. By most
      definitions, what I did wasn’t even design—except that it ended up
      creating new things, some of which still exist on the web. Soon I had
      requirements, schedules, and constraints, but most of those were
      self-imposed: for instance, I designed the first A List Apart, published a
      fresh issue every week, and created title illustrations for every article.
      This was design, but self-directed. I found it easy and natural and it
      never felt like work at all. But then a curious thing happened: I began to
      get clients. And the more clients I got, and the more complex and
      sophisticated the projects became, the harder design became for me. I wish
      I could say I approach design with fearless joy, but the truth is, the
      longer I do it, the harder and more unnatural it becomes. Starting new
      projects is easy when you have almost no clue what you’re doing—as easy as
      playing is for a child. With experience comes knowledge of all the depth
      and skill you lack. You know how great some design can sometimes be, and
      how unlikely you are to attain anything resembling greatness on any given
      project. The very idea of beginning terrifies you.
