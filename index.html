      <h1>ABOUT</h1>

      <p>
        Established 2010, Hansen House is the label for designer Ethan Hansen
        (that's me). Design is my vocation and my joy. My past work includes 3D
        technical design for film (2009–2012, 2017–2018), digital game art & dev
        (2010-2013), architectural visualization (2010–present), web dev &
        design (2013-present), print production (2017), and advertising design
        (2017–present). I graduated cum laude from Bob Jones University
        (Greenville, SC, United States) with a B.F.A. in Graphic Design. In
        addition to my formal education, I've spent more than a thousand hours
        training with some of the greatest artists, designers, and engineers
        alive by virtue of the staggering generosity of the online creative
        community.
      </p>
